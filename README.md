In this lab you get practice writing ARM assembly code using the ARM Cortex-A9 built into the Cyclone V
FPGA on your DE1-SoC. The ARM Cortex-A9 is full fledged microprocessor found in many smartphones. Writing assembly code for the recursive binary
search algorithm described in Section 3 following the ARM calling conventions is the main task for this lab.
